This uses the Flask web framework to display a Jinja template to get a users name. Then randomly looks up an insult in a json file before concatinating the users name and the json file and displaying it on a second Jinja template. 

A working demo may be available on [Pythonanywhere](http://16c7x.pythonanywhere.com/).
